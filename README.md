# **Mango Markets: Leveraged Trading On DeFi** 

By Rahul Nandwani 24th June 2021



Tired of centralized trading exchanges? It’s time to let that man-go! Mango Markets is a revolutionary new project to build a decentralized trading platform that is friendly to both traders and market makers. In the DeFi world, we tend to focus on the negatives of CeFi a lot. But CeFi has many positives too. One major upside is the endless liquidity CeFi enjoys, which is something DeFi projects tend to struggle with massively due to the chicken and egg TVL conundrum. Another huge advantage is the high-quality user experience these platforms provide, which in turn allows for a seamless interface and attracts more users with its easy accessibility. Mango Markets intends to combine both the liquidity and the usability of CeFi together with the permissionless innovations of DeFi. However, Mango Markets also envisages providing these services for users of both types of platforms at a lower cost. 

Mango Market’s vision has several junctures. Their short term plan consists of building two key features, margin trading or lending and perpetual futures. Margin trading is a method of trading assets using funds provided by a third party. Margin accounts, as opposed to standard trading accounts, allow traders to access larger sums of money, allowing them to leverage their positions. Margin trading essentially magnifies trading results, allowing traders to make higher gains on successful trades (Binance Academy). Similarly, a perpetual contract is a variety of futures contracts that does not have an expiration date, unlike conventional futures. As a result, anyone can continue in a position for as long as they choose (Binance Academy). Mango Markets will heavily feature both, alongside a decentralized governance system to democratize the evolution of the protocol. Mango Market’s goal is to challenge centralized exchanges that might be considered grandiose but the team don’t foresee any potential obstacles. On the contrary, they believe Mango’s permissionless ecosystem will foster and create awe-inspiring and unpredictably innovative ideas that will overtake centralized finance. 



## **Technology**

Mango Markets offers up to 5x, cross-margined leverage for both makers and takers on Serum with a seamless, centralized exchange feel. One of Mango Market’s special features is its unique lending pools. These pools work similar to Aave’s but users are able to collect interest on both their deposits as well as their positions. The current on-chain lending protocols such as AAVE or Compound offer 2x leverage for margin traders. However, there are serious drawbacks to this. Firstly, Ethereum’s high gas prices tend to restrict a large number of traders by pricing them out. And secondly, only market orders or swaps, not limit orders, can be used for margin trading. For market makers, this renders them absolutely useless. And thus, Mango Markets found a niche to fill.

### Benefits

Mango Markets key to success lies in its tripartite strategy of low latency, low transaction cost and full decentralization. It is an astute belief that all three pillars are required for the project to be a success. Thus, all of them being available on Solana powers Mango’s chances of viability higher. The first pillar of latency is feasible due to Solana’s sheer block time speed, which is so quick that it almost defies human perception. The ubiquitous advantage such speed and latency provides is high usability. The majority of individuals get uneasy while waiting for the status of their transaction to be verified. While the fast speed eases this discomfort, the key benefit of such low latency is actually improved liquidity. The quote spreads of liquidity providers are directly correlated to the time needed to amend the quote. The more time it requires to modify a price quote, the greater the market maker's risk of substantial market movement, and the wider his quotes must be to encapsulate the risk. Thus, with the human perception defying latency, Mango Markets envisions their bid-ask spread to be comparable with centralized exchanges. Coupled with low transaction costs, which are the foundation of effective finance, Mango intends to provide all the necessary financial tools for cheaper or comparable to the tools provided by centralised finance. Lower prices show efficiency, and in the long run, more efficient methods and technologies win. 

However, protocols have to strike an equilibrium for fees, which have to be low enough to remain efficient while also financing operations. Mango Markets assures it will maintain low fees invariably. Mango Markets are of the firm belief that maintaining both the low cost and latency on a centralized medium is not sustainable. Having such a central power structure is bound to create a security impediment in the system. Centralising important components means foregoing the enormous benefits of permissionless innovation. Mango Markets will be able to still capitalise on these benefits due to its decentralised nature. Mango's ultimate goal in financial services is to win the long game. The combination of all three pillars, low cost, latency and decentralization will aid its journey to success. 

### Risks

Contrastingly, with every upside are downsides. In the case of Mango Markets, these come in the form of risks. To keep its costs low as mentioned previously, the mango protocol has no interest fees. As a result, there are no insurance funds for the protocol. When there is negative equity in a margin account, the losses are shared among the lenders. Thus, if an individual’s account drops below the required collateral maintenance ratio of 110%, which is the percentage of a loan that’s secured by a discounted asset signalling insufficient collateral, they can lose their margin account. Further, if the account falls below 100% collateral ratio, it can cause a huge threat to the ecosystem. Due to a series of events, this can trigger an onslaught of liquidations that will cause other marginal account’s collateral ratio to fall below 100%. But, these events are highly improbable. 

Smart contract bugs are another such risk. Mango Markets aims to neutralise this using two methods, firstly by working closely with the Solana team to double-check any smart contracts before releasing them. The second method is incentivising the identification of bugs by users by offering rewards for finding them. While care is advised in these early days of DeFi, the team believes that open source and transparent protocols such as Mango Markets will be a safer way to trade and hold money in the long term than centralized counterparts. The Solana Flux Aggregator, which is Mango’s oracle, is brand new in the Solana ecosystem and there are possibilities some errors have not been sieved out of the code yet. It's also possible that the centralized exchanges that provide the pricing have inaccuracies. Price mistakes will affect all oracle price publishers because they all use the same centralized exchanges. This could lead to a rash of botched liquidations. The concluding risk is the possibility of illiquid deposits, which could be attributed to those funds not being able to be withdrawn due to them being borrowed. This can be an issue for someone who requires funds urgently, as well as individuals who have funds staked out as the user may not be able to close a position if the utilization rate is 100%. Notwithstanding this to combat this problem, while the user waits to be allowed to withdraw, the protocol ensures a 100% APY. 



## **Tokenomics** 

First and foremost, the Mango Token is a governance token. It has a max supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens with an initial circulating supply of 2,000,000,000 tokens. There are four groups of beneficiaries of the Mango tokens; creators, Temporary Governance Fund, the DAO and the DAO treasury for the Insurance Fund. Creators hold 5% for the creation of Mango Markets. While the temporary governance fund holds 10%. Until complete governance procedures are launched, these tokens will be used for governance. The large remainder (80%) of the tokens will be held by the DAO. Token holder governance is the only way to unlock these tokens. Similar to Bitcoins, emissions are halved every two years for supply control.

Following the initial distribution of tokens, the DAO will take over as the primary distributor. In terms of governance, through governance recommendations, the DAO may be able to distribute more tokens. This alludes that token holders will have direct control over the protocol and will be able to alter it whenever they want. The minimum amount of tokens to be held to wield governance control is 0.1% of the Mango token supply. This is also the minimum amount required to stake Mango tokens. These token holders can also propose a number of other actions. New asset listings, modifying asset collateral components, updating market interest rate models, and other acts are examples of these actions. Proposals are executable code, not proposals to be implemented by a team or foundation. Every proposal is subject to a three-day voting session, during which any Mango Token staker can vote for it or against it. If the proposal receives a majority of votes and at least 2% of the total Mango Token supply, it is filed in the Timelock and can be executed after two days. 



## **Team**

The Mango Markets Protocol was founded by Maximillian Schneider and Dafydd Durairaj. Dafydd Durairaj was trained in crypto market making for the entirety of his career and has vast experience building market-making algorithms for different crypto exchanges. While Maximillian Schneider, a self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, started to take interest in DeFi during the DeFi summer of 2020. He met Dafydd on Discord while attempting to learn about how Serum worked. Dafydd introduced a concept for leveraged trading to Maximillian and the rest is history. This concept was initially titled “Levrum” or “Leverage on Serum”. Interestingly enough, Dafydd who lives in San Francisco and Maximillian who lives in Berlin has never met and built the entire protocol without ever having to by working over 12 hours a day together. Their hardwork paid off as they won the Solana x Serum hackathon. Like a true success story of the DeFi age, it has all the crypto ingredients of Discord, algorithms, a summer boom and globalisation.
